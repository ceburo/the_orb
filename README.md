# Mia - The Orb 🔮

**Mia** turns your VS Code editor into a productivity mini-RPG. A mystic orb lives in your activity bar, feeding on your code to grow and evolve.

## How to Play?

1.  Install the extension.
2.  Open the **Mia** view (click the orb in the activity bar).
3.  Code! The orb reacts to every keystroke.

## Game Mechanics 🎮

### 1. Gain XP
*   **Type Code**: Every edit earns you XP.
*   *Note*: Comments (`//`, `/*`, `#`) are ignored by the orb (it feeds on pure logic only!).

### 2. The Commit Multiplier 🚀
Consistency is key.
*   Every **Git Commit** increases your XP multiplier by **+0.2x**.
*   The boost is cumulative (up to a maximum of **x5.0**)!
*   *Example*: After 5 commits, you earn 2x more XP for every line of code.

### 3. Visual Evolution
*   **Growth**: The orb physically grows in the window as you gain XP.
*   **Levels**: Reach the XP threshold to level up (the orb changes color and pulses with energy).
*   **Difficulty**: Each level requires 50% more XP than the previous one.

### 4. Endgame: Mitosis 🧬
What happens when you reach the maximum multiplier of **x5.0**?
*   If you commit once more, the energy becomes unstable... and **Mitosis** triggers!
*   **Effect**: Your multiplier resets to x1.0.
*   **Reward**: Your orb splits in two! You now have **2 Orbs** (then 4, 8...) gathering XP simultaneously. Your gains are dramatically accelerated.

## Commands

*   `mia.addXp`: Adds 10 XP (useful for testing animations).

**Good luck, Elite Coder!**
